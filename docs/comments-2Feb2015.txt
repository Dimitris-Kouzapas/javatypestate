In SellerMain.ses we commented out the call of
seller.sendPriceToBuyer1 on line 32.

The error message we expect is that seller.receiveLabelFromBuyer2 is
called when seller.sendPriceToBuyer1 should be called.

The error message we get is that seller.sendPriceToBuyer1 is called
when seller.receiveTitleFromBuyer1 should be called.

This could be explained by the fact that method calls are analysed in
reverse order. We think it's important to produce error messages that
correspond to analysing the method calls forwards.



The file positions seem to be reported correctly.


"Missmatch" should be "mismatch".


There are two categories of error:

1. Calling a method that is not allowed at the current point in the
typestate specification.

2. Failing to complete the typestate specification.

Both errors seem to be producing the same form of error message, but
we think that maybe there should be different error messages. However,
if error reporting is done forwards, probably this error message would
become clearer.



If we remove the first method call, then the error message refers to
Init Node, which we think is an extra node used in your graph
representation. If error reporting is done forwards, then what we
would like to see for this error is the set of methods that could be
called, and the method that has been called. If this is a point in the
typestate specification that corresponds to a named state, then it
would be useful to report the name of the state.

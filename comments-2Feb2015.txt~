In SellerMain.ses we commented out the call of
seller.sendPriceToBuyer1 on line 32.

The error message we expect is that seller.receiveLabelFromBuyer2 is
called when seller.sendPriceToBuyer1 should be called.

The error message we get is that seller.sendPriceToBuyer1 is called
when seller.receiveTitleFromBuyer1 should be called.

This could be explained by the fact that method calls are analysed in
reverse order.

\section{Introduction}

If we intend to have more examples that target the existing language,
it would be useful to clarify the goals and target audience, and feed
this information into the roadmap for developing the language and
implementation. For example, compatibility might be irrelevant or
important. (It might be important if we want to make the idea more
plausible, or if we want to get some feedback from actual users.)
There are implications: for example aiming for compatibility would
suggest using annotations instead of new bespoke syntax if possible.

As another example, are we specifically interested in communication?
If so, are we only interested in communication over sockets? Is the
goal to demonstate that typestate can be used for typing channels, or
that the resulting programming model is convenient and user-friendly?
Again, there are implications for how we design the language.

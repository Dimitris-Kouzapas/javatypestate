//TODO list

-	add ByteCodeReader

-	In the first version we expect only "linear" methods to return typestate objects.
	Consider adding info in the typestate file for the return type of "non-linear" methods.
	Research for inference of the return typestate type.

-	Add link type e.g. code like

		EnumType e = o.foo();

		switch(e.getEnum()) {
			...
		}

		should be accepted

-	Add cross-reference labels in typestate definitions e.g

	typestate ThisTypestate {
		session 
				{ Init = Obj <ThatTypestate.State> foo() : Continue }
	}

	with State defined in ThatTypestate.

	The semantic checks should change.

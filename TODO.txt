//TODO list

-	add ByteCodeReader

-	In the first version we expect only "linear" methods to return typestate objects.
	Consider adding info in the typestate file for the return type of "non-linear" methods.
	Research for inference of the return typestate type.

-	Calling a method on the this keyword
	A "non-linear" method that alters the typestate type of the field cannot be called outside
	its class.
	A method ("linear" and "non-linear") that can alter the typestate of the fields can be called on the this keyword
	only inside a "linear" method??
	Take care when you are calling methods that alter the typestate of an object on the this keyword. Should
	concatanate the types correctly.

-	First do the semantic check and then do the typestateCheck given that the semantic check is correct!!

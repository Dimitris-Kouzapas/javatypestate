// My proposal is to consider the typestate as a specification only of the _services_
// provided by a process, not of its internal actions. This means considering only 
// "from" messages in the local projection. No longer need to include "receive" in the
// generated method name as that is implied.

// Like Scribble, this remains agnostic about whether any particular implementation
// is "distributed".

// Question: do we lose information from the global type by only including the "from"
// messages in the local types? In the binary case no, but in the multiparty case, 
// perhaps yes.
